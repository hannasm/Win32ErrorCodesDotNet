# Overview
This project contains a file mirroring some unknown version of the winerror.h that seems to be dated around 2005, so it probably has most of your staple error codes but won't have any of your bleeding edge error code definitions.

This code is copy / pasted from some obscure place on a dead google code reprository, it doesn't seem to have a license associated with it.
